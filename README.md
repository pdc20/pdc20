Computer programming to me is more than just a hobby. Not one bit in me years ago believed that learning Python would launch me into the galaxy of computing, comprising of so many interesting skills to learn. From practical software development to pure computing theory I've learned various topics from these planets of invaluable knowledge and there's so much more out there that I'm keen to explore and discover.
